## My .config

### *Work in Progress*

My current setup.
Feel free to look through it.\
It probably won't work out of the box.\
If you want to try something from it, research it first.

    OS: Arch Linux
    Window Manager: Sway
    Terminal: Foot with Tmux 
    Shell: Zsh
    Editor: Neovim
---
### Features
---
- Tiling Window Manager with Vim-like keybinds

- Vim like keybinds to navigate Firefox

- Seamless pane switching within terminal multiplex panes and neovim panes

- Caps lock remapped to ESC and CTRL

- Easy installation of native language servers for Neovim

- Fully integrated IDE in Neovim

- Light footprint, would probably run on a potato
